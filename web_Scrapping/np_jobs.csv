Integrated Statistics is looking for a Data Management Coordinator to work with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and Greater Atlantic Regional Field Office (GARFO). The Data Management Coordinator will work directly with staff from GARFO, NEFSC, and the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP) on a database merger project that will incorporate state fisheries data into a single comprehensive database for all US commercial fisheries catch in the Northeast. The position may be located in either Gloucester, MA or Woods Hole, MA. The position may begin with a period of remote work, to accommodate pandemic restrictions. 

Currently, NEFSC and GARFO have two parallel systems for catch monitoring and accounting, with the GARFO-led system focusing on quota monitoring and the NEFSC-led system supporting stock assessments and other research activities. The two systems each integrate data across a wide array of fishery information systems, and each approaches that integration slightly differently. Both systems require significant maintenance and upgrading as regulations and data streams change frequently. The Catch Accounting and Monitoring System (CAMS) implementation team is creating a single comprehensive database for all federal Northeast US fisheries catch.

The Data Management Coordinator will work with the CAMS Project Manager and state natural resource managers to incorporate state data that is reported to ACCSP into CAMS. The Data Coordinator will also develop the technical specifications that ensure state data reporting to ACCSP is at a sufficient level of detail to allow incorporation in the CAMS database. The state data will remain housed at ACCSP, but will be linked to GARFO via relational database tables that integrate state fisheries-dependent data into CAMS.

Duties
The task includes but is not limited to these duties:

    Coordinating the inclusion of state fisheries catch and effort data, including working with states to ensure their data reporting to ACCSP is at a sufficient level of detail to allow incorporation into the CAMS database.
    Coordinating accurate, complete, and timely transfer of state level data from ACCSP to the CAMS database.
    Working with the internal CAMS project team to develop a data management plan that outlines data capture, data flow, data queries, manual checks, and data listing to ensure data integrity.
    Developing a process/method to ensure ACCSP’s Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program provides timely feedback and correction of state data that parallels GARFO’s QA/QC program in coordination with the CAMS project team.
    Working with data scientists to develop data management and visualization tools, including gathering/defining user requirements and performing user testing.

Qualifications and Skills
The Data Management Coordinator must:

    Demonstrate proficiency in designing, creating, and implementing Oracle database systems.
    Possess strong programming and development skills using PL/SQL (package, procedures, functions, triggers) and batch coding skills.
    Possess the ability to manage large datasets, query, extract, and organize data in useful ways to reduce performance related issues.
    Have experience in code migration, database change management and data management in multiple environments and different stages of the development life cycle.
    Possess experience with data backup, data recovery, data dictionaries, and data standardization processes.
    Possess the ability to handle multiple projects and deadlines with flexibility between tasks.
    Have a track record of ensuring performance, security, integrity, and availability of databases.
    Be able to support application development through integrated project work group meetings, data modeling, code reviews, and system reviews for quality and performance.
    Demonstrate ability to work with management and developers in providing quick resolutions during critical production issues with performance related resolutions.
    Implement and integrate security standards set by the NOAA/NMFS/ Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).
    Possess excellent written and oral communication skills..

The position is expected to last one year. The position can be located in either Gloucester MA or Woods Hole MA. There is a possibility for some remote work. The position is eligible for the pay and benefits described on the Integrated Statistics website.
