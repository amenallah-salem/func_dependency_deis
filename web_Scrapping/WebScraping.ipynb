The Data Management Coordinator will work directly with staff from GARFO, NEFSC, and the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP) on a database merger project that will incorporate state fisheries data into a single comprehensive database for all US commercial fisheries catch in the Northeast.
